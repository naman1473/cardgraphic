Hi Naman,

this is the starter pack for the project. All images are found in **/images** folder. The source file is: **game.py**

The screen dimensions are shown on the image below. The whole screen size is 1200x850px. I think, it'd be nice to have some margin around ~17px. The player's area is 200px wide on both side, while the cards are 60x82px.

**STEPS**

- create a directory on your machine and copy all files from here
- type the following: 
  - _git init_
  - _git add ._
  - _git commit -m "Initial commit."_
  - (Create a new private repo at GitHub.com)
  - _git remote add origin **yourgithubrepoaddresscomeshere**_
  - _git push origin master_

- you need to install [**pygame**](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

- to run the project: _python3 game.py_
- you will see a card on the top left corner



**TODO**

- can you move the card the middle of the screen? 
- can you build the card programatically shown on the image: ![test card](/Users/szabolcs/Desktop/game/test card.png)

_(Tipp: the images are in /png format, so they are transparent, you can put images on top of each other...)_
